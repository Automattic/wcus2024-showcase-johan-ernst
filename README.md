# Engineering for the Automattic Special Projects Team: johanernst.com

This repository contains the functional code implementing the globe interface on [johanernst.com](https://johanernst.com). It was [presented by Mike Straw during Showcase Day at WordCamp US 2024](https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/session/engineering-for-the-automattic-special-projects-team/).

While all of the working code is present, this is not a fully functional plugin as the code was extracted from a theme and MU plugins. It should, however, give a developer the information needed to implement similar functionality on their own site.
